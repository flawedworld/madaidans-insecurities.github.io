  <h1>Firefox and Chromium</h1>

  <p class="date"><i><time datetime="2021-04-26">Last edited: April 26, 2021</time></i></p>

  <p>
    Chromium is vastly more secure than Firefox. Firefox's sandboxing and exploit mitigations are much weaker than Chromium's.
    This article is not blindly hating on Firefox but is a factual analysis of its weaknesses.
  </p>

  <h2 id="sandboxing"><a href="#sandboxing">Sandboxing</a></h2>

  <p>
    Sandboxing is a technique used to isolate certain programs to prevent a vulnerability in them from compromising
    the rest of the system. All common browsers nowadays include a sandbox. The browser splits itself up into different
    processes (e.g. the content process, GPU process, RDD process, etc.) and sandboxes them individually. It is very important
    that a browser uses a sandbox. Otherwise, any exploit in the browser can be used to take over the rest of the system.
    With a sandbox, they would need to chain their exploit with an additional sandbox escape vulnerability. <br>
    <br>
    However, sandboxes are not black and white. Just having a sandbox doesn't do much if it's full of holes. Firefox's
    sandbox is quite weak for the following reasons. Note that this is a non-exhaustive list and the issues below are only a
    few examples of such weaknesses.
  </p>

  <h3 id="site-isolation"><a href="#site-isolation">Site Isolation</a></h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">Firefox's sandboxing</a> lacks any <a
    href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">site isolation</a>. Site isolation runs
    every website inside its own sandbox so that an exploit in one website cannot access the data from another. In addition,
    <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/07/mitigating-spectre-with-site-isolation.html">site isolation is necessary
    for complete protection against side-channel attacks like Spectre</a>. Mozilla is working on site isolation with <a
    href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Fission">Project Fission</a> but it is still a work in progress and is not yet fit
    for actual use. The sandbox is currently only focused on isolating the browser as a whole from the rest of the operating
    system and even that is still not great.
  </p>

  <h3 id="windows-sandbox"><a href="#windows-sandbox">Windows</a></h3>

  <p>
    Excluding the issue
    of site isolation, only the Firefox sandbox on Windows is comparable to the <a
    href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md">Chromium sandbox</a> but even then,
    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=win32k">it still lacks</a> <a
    href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md#win32k_sys-lockdown">win32k lockdown</a>. Win32k is a set of
    dangerous system calls in the NT kernel that expose a lot of attack surface and <a
    href="https://github.com/microsoft/MSRC-Security-Research/blob/master/presentations/2018_10_DerbyCon/2018_10_DerbyCon_State_of%20_Win32k_Security.pdf">
    has historically been the result of numerous vulnerabilities</a>. Microsoft aimed to lessen this risk by introducing a feature that <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-process_mitigation_system_call_disable_policy"> allows a process to block access
    to these syscalls</a>, therefore massively reducing attack surface. <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/11/breaking-chain.html">Chromium
    implemented this in 2016</a> to strengthen the sandbox but Firefox has yet to follow suit — <a
    href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/a5bf5d0720f9454687f500513ac82b0c8abce5a4/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.yaml#10133">
    Firefox currently only enables this in the socket process</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="linux-sandbox"><a href="#linux-sandbox">Linux</a></h3>

  <h4 id="linux-sandbox-escapes"><a href="#linux-sandbox-escapes">Sandbox Escapes</a></h4>

  <p>
    Firefox's sandboxing on other platforms such as Linux is significantly worse. The restrictions are generally quite permissive and it is even susceptible to various
    trivial sandbox escape vulnerabilities that span back years, as well as exposing sizable attack surface from within the sandbox.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      One example of such sandbox escape flaws is X11 — <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">X11
      doesn't implement any GUI isolation</a> which makes it <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/42320.html">very easy to escape sandboxes with it</a>. Chromium
      resolves this issue by only permitting access to X11 from within the GPU process so that the renderer process (the process in which websites are loaded) cannot
      access it, whereas on Firefox, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1129492">it is exposed directly to the content process</a>.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a> is a common sound server on Linux however, <a
      href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/AccessControl/">it was not written with isolation in mind</a>, making it
      possible to escape sandboxes with it. Like X11, <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=pulseaudio&path=security%2Fsandbox%2Flinux">Firefox
      exposes this directly to the content process</a>, permitting another trivial sandbox escape, while Chromium only exposes it to a broker process.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="seccomp-bpf"><a href="#seccomp-bpf">seccomp-bpf</a></h4>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html">seccomp-bpf</a> is a sandboxing technology on Linux that allows one to restrict
    the syscalls accessible by a process which can greatly reduce kernel attack surface and is a core part of most Linux sandboxes. However, Firefox's seccomp filter
    is far less restrictive than Chromium's. An example of this is that there is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1302711">very little ioctl
    filtering</a> — <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/9ae77e4ce3378bd683ac9a86b729ea6b6bd22cb8/security/sandbox/linux/SandboxFilter.cpp#1291">
    only TTY-related ioctls are blocked</a>. This is problematic as ioctl is a massive kernel attack surface that comprises of hundreds of different syscalls,
    somewhat similar to NT's Win32k. Android <a href="https://kernsec.org/files/lss2015/vanderstoep.pdf">implemented ioctl filtering in its application sandbox</a>
    for this exact reason. Unlike Firefox, Chromium permits only the few ioctls that are necessary in its sandbox which reduces kernel attack surface by a considerable
    amount.
  </p>

  <h3 id="android-sandbox"><a href="#android-sandbox">Android</a></h3>

  <p>
    On Android, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565196">Firefox does not have a sandbox at all beyond the OS app sandbox</a>, while Chromium uses the
    <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element#isolated"><code>isolatedProcess</code> feature</a>, along with a more strict seccomp-bpf filter.
  </p>

  <h3 id="gpu-process"><a href="#gpu-process">GPU Process Sandboxing</a></h3>

  <p>
    On Linux, there is also <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1653444">no separate GPU process</a>, meaning it cannot be independently sandboxed.
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Process_model#GPU_Process">This process exists on Windows</a> however, <a
    href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1347710">the sandboxing for it is still not enabled</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="exploit-mitigations"><a href="#exploit-mitigations">Exploit Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    Exploit mitigations eliminate entire classes of common vulnerabilities / exploit techniques to prevent or severely hinder exploitation.
    Firefox lacks many important mitigations, while Chromium generally excels in this area. <br>
    <br>
    As with the sandboxing, there are many more issues than the ones listed below but this article does not attempt to be an exhaustive list.
    You can look through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home">Mozilla's own bug tracker</a> for further examples.
  </p>

  <h3 id="acg-cig"><a href="#acg-cig">Arbitrary Code Guard and Code Integrity Guard</a></h3>

  <p>
    A very common exploit technique is that during exploitation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer overflow</a>
    vulnerability, an attacker injects their own malicious code (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode">shellcode</a>) into a
    part of memory and causes the program to execute it by overwriting critical data such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_statement">
    return addresses</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer">function pointers</a> to hijack the control flow and point to the
    aforementioned shellcode, thereby gaining control over the program. <br>
    <br>
    The industry eventually evolved to mitigate this style of attacks by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection">marking
    writable areas of memory as non-executable</a> and executable areas as non-writable, preventing an attacker from injecting and executing their shellcode.
    However, an attacker can bypass this by reusing bits of code already present within the program (known as gadgets) outside of the order in which
    they were originally intended to be used. An attacker can form a chain of such gadgets to achieve near-arbitrary code execution despite the
    aforementioned protections, utilising techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">Return-Oriented
    Programming</a> (ROP) or <a href="https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/xjiang4/pubs/ASIACCS11.pdf">Jump-Oriented Programming</a> (JOP). <br>
    <br>
    Attackers often inject their shellcode into writable memory pages and then use these code reuse techniques to transition memory pages to executable
    (using syscalls such as <code>mprotect</code> or <code>VirtualAlloc</code>), consequently allowing it to be executed. <a
    href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">Windows 10 implemented a mitigation</a> known as <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference?view=o365-worldwide#arbitrary-code-guard">
    Arbitrary Code Guard</a> (ACG) which mitigates this by ensuring that all executable memory pages are immutable and can never be made writable. <br>
    <br>
    Another mitigation known as <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference?view=o365-worldwide#code-integrity-guard">Code
    Integrity Guard</a> (CIG) is similar to ACG but it applies to the filesystem instead of memory, ensuring that an attacker cannot execute a malicious program
    or library on disk by guaranteeing that all binaries loaded into a process must be signed. Together, ACG and CIG enforce a strict W^X policy in both memory
    and the filesystem. <br>
    <br>
    In 2017, <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/21a5ba4cfdbafc3b0908f9af75c0de30b03d47ec">Chromium implemented support for ACG and CIG</a>
    as <code>MITIGATION_DYNAMIC_CODE_DISABLE</code> and <code>MITIGATION_FORCE_MS_SIGNED_BINS</code> but Firefox has yet to implement comparable support for
    either <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1381050">ACG</a> or <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378417">CIG</a>.
    Currently, <a
    href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/a5bf5d0720f9454687f500513ac82b0c8abce5a4/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp#1146">
    Firefox only enables ACG and CIG in the socket process</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1620114">CIG in the RDD process</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cfi"><a href="#cfi">Control Flow Integrity</a></h3>

  <p>
    As briefly mentioned before, code reuse attacks can be used to achieve near-arbitrary code execution by chaining together snippets of code that already
    exist in the program. ACG and CIG only mitigate one potential attack vector — creating a ROP/JOP chain to transition mappings to executable. However, an
    attacker can still use a pure ROP/JOP chain, relying wholly on the pre-existing gadgets without needing to introduce their own code. This can be mitigated
    with <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/10/17/lets-talk-about-cfi-clang-edition/">Control Flow Integrity</a> (CFI) which severely restricts the
    gadgets an attacker is able to make use of, thus disrupting their chain. <br>
    <br>
    CFI usually has 2 parts: forward-edge protection (covering JOP, COP, etc.) and backward-edge protection (covering ROP). CFI implementations can vary significantly.
    Some CFI implementations only cover either forward-edges or backward-edges. Some are coarse-grained (the attacker has more freeway to execute a larger amount
    of instructions) rather than fine-grained. Some are probabilistic (they rely on a secret being held and the security properties are not guaranteed) rather than
    deterministic. <br>
    <br>
    Mozilla has been <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510629">planning to implement CFI for a while</a>
    but has yet to make much progress. On Linux, Android and ChromeOS, <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity">Chromium enables
    Clang's fine-grained forward-edge CFI</a> and on Windows, it <a
    href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies">enables the coarse-grained forward-edge Control
    Flow Guard</a> (CFG). <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438868">Firefox only enables CFG on Windows</a> which is not as effective as Clang's
    CFI due to it being coarse-grained rather than fine-grained and does not apply to other platforms.
  </p>

  <h3 id="jit-hardening"><a href="#jit-hardening">JIT Hardening</a></h3>

  <p>
    All common browsers include a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compiler</a> to improve performance. There is an inherent security
    hole in JIT however and that is the requirement of memory that is both writable and executable — a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">W^X</a> violation
    which, <a href="#acg-cig">as discussed above</a>, can aid exploitation. In an attempt to lessen the security risks posed by this feature without sacrificing the
    performance gains, <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ndss2017_10-4_Lian_paper.pdf">browsers have adopted JIT hardening techniques</a>
    to make exploiting the JIT compiler significantly more difficult. <a href="https://github.com/struct/research/blob/master/Attacking_Clientside_JIT_Compilers_Paper.pdf">
    In a study on attacking JIT compilers by Chris Rohlf</a>, the hardening techniques implemented in various JIT engines were analysed and compared. This study showed that
    the JIT engine in Chromium (<a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a>) has substantially better protections than the one used in Firefox (<a
    href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/JaegerMonkey">JaegerMonkey</a>). In particular, the mitigations which Chromium used that Firefox did not use include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Guard pages.</li>
    <li>Page randomization.</li>
    <li>Constant blinding.</li>
    <li>Allocation restrictions.</li>
    <li>NOP insertions.</li>
    <li>Random code base offset.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Since the publication of the paper, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677272">Firefox has not made much progress on adopting these techniques</a>.
    Examples of such include <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376819"> constant blinding</a> and <a
    href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729824">NOP insertion</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Firefox attempted to harden the JIT engine by adding a so-called "W^X JIT" but this fails to hinder actual exploits as it is vulnerable to a race window in which an attacker can
    write their shellcode to the memory mapping when it's writable and wait for the engine to transition it to executable. Additionally, due to the lack of CFI in Firefox, there are
    also many gadgets available for an attacker to force transition the mapping to executable such as <code>ExecutableAllocator::makeExecutable</code> or <code>mprotect</code> /
    <code>VirtualAlloc</code> in the C library. Something similar to Safari's <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/jitsploitation-three.html">"Bulletproof JIT"</a>
    would have been a better approach, utilising two separate mappings — one writable and one executable with the writable mapping being placed at a secret location in memory, concealed
    via execute-only memory. <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://archive.fo/9aBLk">As PaX Team noted in 2015</a>: <br>
    <br>
  </p>

  <p class="quote">
    > but for this to be safe, the RW mapping should be in a separate process. <br>
    <br>
    note that this is a weakness in the current mprotect based method as well as there's still a nice race window for overwriting the JIT generated code. the only safe way i know of for JIT
    codegen is to basically fall back to what amounts to AOT codegen, i.e., a separate process (this would make it compatible with MPROTECT in PaX). there's prior art for the V8 engine btw,
    check out the SDCG work presented at NDSS'15: http://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/papers/sdcg.pdf and https://github.com/ChengyuSong/v8-sdcg . <br>
    [...]<br>
    second, since there's no control-flow integrity employed by Firefox (and it can't have one until certain bad code constructs get rewritten) those 'few code paths' you mention are abusable
    by redirecting control flow there (ExecutableAllocator::makeExecutable is an obvious ROP target if one's lazy to find mprotect itself in libc). <br>
    <br>
    as for the size of the race window, there're two problems with it: first, there're many such windows as there're a lot of users of AutoWritableJitCode (including embeddings) that execute
    lots of code during those windows (have you actually measured how long those windows are?). second, the window can effectively be extended to arbitrary lengths by first overwriting
    ExecutableAllocator::nonWritableJitCode to false. <br>
    <br>
    in summary, this is a half-baked security measure that is DOA.
  </p>

  <h3 id="memory-allocator-hardening"><a href="#memory-allocator-hardening">Memory Allocator Hardening</a></h3>

  <p>
    Furthermore, Firefox lacks a hardened memory allocator. Firefox currently uses <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/build/mozjemalloc.cpp">
    mozjemalloc</a> which is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc">jemalloc</a>. Jemalloc is a performance-oriented
    memory allocator — it does not have a focus on security which makes it <a
    href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/Argyoudis/BH_US_12_Argyroudis_Exploiting_the_%20jemalloc_Memory_%20Allocator_Slides.pdf">
    very prone to exploitation</a>. Mozjemalloc does add on a few security features to jemalloc which is useful but <a
    href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-August/013990.html">they are not enough to
    fix the issues present in the overall architecture of the allocator</a>. Chromium instead uses <a
    href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md">
    PartitionAlloc</a> (throughout the entire codebase due to <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/04/efficient-and-safe-allocations-everywhere.html">PartitionAlloc-Everywhere</a>) which is
    substantially more hardened than mozjemalloc is. <br>
    <br>
    In comparison to mozjemalloc, <a href="https://struct.github.io/partition_alloc.html">examples of the security features present in PartitionAlloc</a> which do not exist in mozjemalloc,
    include but are not limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      Robust memory partitioning with strong isolation — <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052575">mozjemalloc does have some support for partitions</a> however, <a
      href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1446046">memory is reused across partitions</a>, thus severely weakening this feature and allowing it to be bypassed, whereas <a
      href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md#security">strong memory partitioning with no reused memory between partitions
      is one of PartitionAlloc's core goals</a>. In fact, a real-world exploit used by the FBI to unmask users of the Tor Browser <a href="https://nitter.snopyta.org/dguido/status/803838692645335040">
      was possible due to the lack of memory partitioning</a>.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Out-of-line metadata — <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1446045">mozjemalloc currently has heap metadata in-line</a>, whereas <a
      href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md#security">PartitionAlloc stores metadata out-of-line in a dedicated region</a>.
      PartitionAlloc also uses guard pages to ensure this feature's effectiveness; <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1446040">another security feature that mozjemalloc lacks</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In addition, PartitionAlloc is working on many promising upcoming security features such as their <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QvfZXx5HdUl0IdkBcrx-NM0ua-PVcTi2jNx0Sf-n8Fo/">
    MiraclePtr and *Scan</a> projects to effectively mitigate most use-after-free exploits.
  </p>

  <h3 id="auto-var-init"><a href="#auto-var-init">Automatic Variable Initialization</a></h3>

  <p>
    One of the most common classes of memory corruption vulnerabilities is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable">uninitialized memory</a>. Clang has an option to
    <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D54604">automatically initialize stack variables</a> with either zero or a specific pattern, thus mitigating this class of vulnerabilities for the stack. <a
    href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/7d38bae3ef691d5091b6d4d7973a9b4d2cd85eb2/build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn#125">Chromium enables this by default on all platforms except
    Android</a>, whereas <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1546873">Firefox only enables it in debugging builds</a> for uncovering bugs and is not used in production to mitigate
    exploits. <br>
    <br>
    As for the heap, both PartitionAlloc and mozjemalloc zero-fill allocations so they are equivalent in that regard.
  </p>

  <h2 id="miscellaneous"><a href="#miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></h2>

  <p>
    Firefox <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Oxidation">does have some parts written in Rust, a memory safe language</a>,
    but the majority of the browser is still written in memory unsafe languages and the parts that are memory safe do not include important attack
    surfaces so this isn't anything substantial and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety">Chromium is working on
    switching to memory safe languages too</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, writing parts in a memory safe language does not necessarily improve security and may even <i>degrade</i> security by allowing for
    bypasses of exploit mitigations. Some security features are geared towards a particular language and in an environment where different languages
    are mixed, <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">those features may be bypassed by abusing the other language</a>. For
    example, when mixing C and Rust code in the same binary with CFI enabled, the integrity of the control flow will be guaranteed in the C code but the
    Rust code will remain unchanged because buffer overflows are impossible in Rust anyway. However, this allows an attacker to bypass CFI by exploiting
    a buffer overflow in the C code and then abusing the lack of protection in the Rust code to hijack the control flow. Mixed binaries can be secure but
    only if those security features are applied for all languages. Currently, <a href="https://opensrcsec.com/open_source_security_announces_rust_gcc_funding">
    compilers generally don't support this</a>, excluding <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">
    Windows' Control Flow Guard support in Clang</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Firefox also uses <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">RLBox</a> but <a
    href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1673529">this is only used to sandbox two libraries</a> (<a
    href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566288">Graphite</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1625876">Ogg</a>) which
